// Write a constructor for making “Book” objects. We will revisit this in the project at the end of this lesson. Your book objects should have the book’s title, author, the number of pages, and whether or not you have read the book.

function Book(title, author, pages, read) {
    this.title = title
    this.author = author
    this.pages = pages
    this.read = read
    this.info = function(){
        return `${title} by ${author}, ${pages} pages, ${read}`
    }
  }

  const atlas = new Book('Atlas Shrugged', 'Ayn Rand', 1000, 'not read')
  console.log(atlas.info())
